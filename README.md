# Bouncing Squares
By Sebastian S and Harold P
02_harold_sebastian_project

Our project is a simulation of square graphics objects on a canvas course or map. The squares will bounce 
around the map and potentially each other until all of them reach a designated zone or zones. In "race" mode, 
the designated zone will be a finish line and placements/winners will be determined by the order in which the
squares cross the line. Whereas in "deathmatch" mode, placements/winners will be determined by the reverse 
order in which the squares enter the zones. 

The inspiration for this project comes from @project_jdm on YouTube, who makes short-form videos of this variety.

We chose this project because we enjoy watching these simulations and are interested in creating similar simulations with our own twist.

The majority of coding for this project will involve asking the user to customize their game and select a map, setting up a canvas, drawing on a course, creating the square objects, animating the squares so that they are launched at a random starting angle, implementing collisions with the boundries of the course and each other (which will be a selectable setting for the user), stopping the animation when all of the squares have finished or only one remains, and asking the user if they wish to play again. 

Harold will create the foundation for the code, outlining classes and the main objects of the program. Sebastian will implement the courses/maps. From there, we will determine who will perform which specific duties based on our schedules and availability, but a large part of the coding will likely be done together.
