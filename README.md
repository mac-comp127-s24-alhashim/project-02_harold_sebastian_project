## Description
Our project is a simulation of square graphics objects on a canvas course or map. The squares will bounce around the map and
potentially each other until all of them reach a designated zone or zones. In "race" mode, the designated zone will be a 
finish line and placements/winners will be determined by the order in which the squares cross the line. Whereas in 
"deathmatch" mode, placements/winners will be determined by the reverse order in which the squares enter the zones. 

## Inspiration
The inspiration for this project comes from @project_jdm on YouTube, who makes short-form videos of this variety like: https://youtube.com/shorts/2D_7zhpqHMI?si=tgFZFDU4D_dLvf2K and https://youtube.com/shorts/-00rjsVTPYc?si=8e_N__7eljRYTYVO

## Motivation
We chose this project because we enjoy watching these simulations and are interested in creating similar simulations with our own twist.

## Rough Implementation
The majority of coding for this project will involve asking the user to customize their game and select a map, setting up a
canvas, drawing on a course, creating the square objects, animating the squares so that they are launched at a random 
starting angle, implementing collisions with the boundaries of the course and each other (which will be a selectable setting
for the user), stopping the animation when all of the squares have finished or only one remains, and asking the user if they
wish to play again. 

## Responsibility Plan
Harold will create the foundation for the code, outlining classes and the main objects of the program. Sebastian will 
implement the courses/maps. From there, we will determine who will perform which specific duties based on our schedules and
availability, but a large part of the coding will likely be done together. 

## Sketch

This low-fidelity prototype depicts the expected behavior of our Squares Game. Our first map is the race to the finish line,
Our 2nd map/game mode is Square survival from the death zones, The last Square standing wins.
